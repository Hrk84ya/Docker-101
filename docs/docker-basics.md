# Docker Basics

## Introduction to Docker
Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate application deployment, scaling, and management. Docker packages applications into standardized units called containers that include everything needed to run the software, including libraries, dependencies, and the application code.

Using Docker, developers can ensure their applications run consistently across different environments, from development to production, without worrying about system differences.

## Containers
A Docker container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software: code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. Containers are isolated from one another and the host system, which makes them portable and secure. It is a running instance of an image. Also, it's mutable.

## Key Features of Containers:
- Isolation: Each container runs in its own environment, ensuring that it won’t interfere with others.
- Portability: Containers can run on any system that supports Docker (Linux, Windows, macOS).
- Efficiency: Unlike virtual machines (VMs), containers share the host system’s kernel, making them more efficient and faster to start.

## Basic Commands
- Run a container: ```docker run -it ubuntu```     # This runs an interactive ubuntu container
- List running containers: ```docker ps```
- Stop a running container: ```docker stop <container-id>```

## Image
A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and immutable file that contains everything needed to run a container. An image is created from a set of instructions written in a Dockerfile and can be stored in Docker Hub or other container registries. It is immutable.
### Image contains:
- A cut-down OS
- A runtime environment
- Application files
- Third-party libraries
- Environment Variables

## Key Features of Images:
- Layered Filesystem: Images are composed of multiple layers, where each layer represents a different stage in the Dockerfile. Layers make images more efficient, as Docker only updates the modified layers.
- Immutability: Once an image is created, it cannot be modified. However, you can create new images based on an existing one.

## Basic commands
- Pull an image: ```docker pull nginx```    # This pulls the latest nginx image from Docker Hub
- List available images: ```docker images```
- Build an image from a Dockerfile: ```docker build -t docker-basics```

## Volumes

Docker volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. While containers are ephemeral (i.e., their data is lost when they stop), volumes provide a way to store data outside of the container lifecycle.

### Types of Volumes:
1. Named Volumes: Managed by Docker and stored in a specific location on the host.
2. Bind Mounts: Link specific directories or files on the host to the container. These are commonly used for development.

## Basic Commands
- Create a volume: ```docker volume create my_volume```
- Mount a volume to a container: ```docker run -v my_volume:/app/data my_app```
- List all volumes: ```docker volume ls```

## Networks

Docker networks enable communication between containers, whether on the same host or across different hosts. By default, Docker containers can communicate over a bridge network, but custom networks can be created to meet specific needs.

### Types of Docker Networks:
1. Bridge Network (default): Used when containers need to communicate on the same host.
2. Host Network: Directly connects the container to the host’s network.
3. Overlay Network: Enables containers to communicate across multiple Docker hosts, typically used in swarm mode.

## Basic Commands
- List all networks: ```docker network ls```
- Create a new network: ```docker network create my_network```
- Run a container on a specific network: ```docker run --network my_network my_app```


## Conclusion

Docker simplifies the development, testing, and deployment of applications by providing lightweight containers. Containers encapsulate all dependencies and configurations, ensuring consistency across environments. With Docker, you can leverage images, containers, volumes, and networks to build robust, scalable, and maintainable applications.
